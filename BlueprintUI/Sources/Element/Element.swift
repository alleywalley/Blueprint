// MARK: Value Type Validation
//


///
/// This protocol exists to enforce at compile time that your `Element` are value types like `struct` or `enum`.
///
/// It is very very unusual and usually an error to make an `Element` a `class` type. Blueprint's internal
/// implementation relies on the fact that passed in `Element` respect value semantics and are owned by the framework.
///
/// Notes
/// -----
/// You should really not make your `Element` be a `class`. If for some reason you really really want to do this,
/// (you should not do this unless you have a good reason, which you probably do not), then override the
/// `elements_should_be_value_types_by_overriding_this_method_i_acknowledge_i_am_in_hard_mode()`
/// method in your `Element` to opt out of this validation â€“ but you probably shouldn't. If you must do this,
/// please ensure that your `Element` is either entirely immutable, or respects value semantics.
