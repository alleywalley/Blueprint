///         return ElementContent(child: Label(text: "ðŸ˜‚"))

    /// Elements generally fall into two types:
    /// - Leaf elements, or elements that have no children. These elements commonly have an intrinsic size, or some
    ///   content that can be measured. Leaf elements typically instantiate their content with
    ///   `ElementContent(measurable:)` or similar.
    /// - Container elements: these element have one or more children, which are arranged by a layout implementation.
    ///   Container elements typically use methods like `ElementContent(layout:configure:)` to instantiate
    ///   their content.
    var content: ElementContent { get }

    /// Returns an (optional) description of the view that should back this element.
    ///
    /// In Blueprint, elements that are displayed using a live `UIView` instance are referred to as "view-backed".
    /// Elements become view-backed by returning a `ViewDescription` value from this method.
    ///
    /// - Parameter bounds: The bounds of this element after layout is complete.
    /// - Parameter subtreeExtent: A rectangle in the local coordinate space that contains any children.
    ///                            `subtreeExtent` will be nil if there are no children.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An optional `ViewDescription`.
